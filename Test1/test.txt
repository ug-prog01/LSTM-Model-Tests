I had Daniel Queada request CQG for Stacey, and when I checked the status of
the request, it shows that it's pending.  After trading, and when you get a
second, can you go into the IT website and approve it?  Call me if you
want me to show you how to do it.

A lot of us are going to be out. Please give me all of the passwords that
may be needed if/when you are out.

We are still waiting on the Agreements to be returned to us for the Camden
Driscoll Ranch #3 Well.  We should receive them by Monday, December 4, 2000.
I spoke with the field guy today (Bobby Husky) and he stated that the well
would not be ready to turn on until 3 weeks from now.  He said that an amine
plant is being installed.  Therefore, we are waiting on them.  This is just
an FYI to everyone.    This will still be booked for December 2000.  Please
forward this email to anyone that I might have left out.

 There is flow os 271 for 04/01/00.  Deal 93472 was not path for the same
day.  Could you please let me know what needs to be done.
 
Per our conversation yesterday afternoon, pls. separate the Centena term deal
from the spot deal in Sitara for March 2000 production.
Also, I need to have the price for the East Texas redelivery changed in
Sitara from HS Index $-.085 to HS Index $-.0825.  This is per the contract
the price for this redelivery point.

Sorry I didn't get these to you last night.  I left the office sooner than
planned.  This list is pretty slim.  I spent much time trying to learn to
trade Waha, which took a considerable amount of time away from producing
reults for you.  With me now concentrating on operations and with the plan to
hire an additional person, this will change.  Let me know if you have any
questions on my list of accomplishments.

Daren,
I'm not sure if you are the person that can make this change for me.  If you
are not, could you please let me know who I need to speak to.
For meter # 78033 and # 78032 for 3/00 production forward, this deal is set
up under the wrong Sitara #, therefore the volumes are not pulling in Sitara.
  The sitara # that it is currently attached to is # 149421 which this deal
was only for 1/00 production.  The new Sitara number that we should be using
is
Sitara # 156387 ( for meter # 78033 ) and Sitara # 156383 ( for meter # 78032
).  I have attached an example  to help see what I am talking about.
( this was for 2/00 production )
Could you please let me know when the change has been made or if there is
something that I need to do. Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )


Derek,
Attached is the document I prepared on GMI.  The areas that I could not find
data for I have left blank .  If you could also check the accuracy of the
information I have already filled in, I would appreciate it.
 

I am disappointed by the lack of internet options.  For someone like myself
that lives in an apartment, it looks like it will be impossible to get high
speed internet access.  Perhaps you would consider cutting a deal with OpTel,
since they provide high speed internet access to every apartment in Houston.
Thank you for time.

Can you please update the 04/01 price for deal # 27253 in Sitara? It
currently has a rate of $2.3043 (last month's price). The customer invoiced a
rate of $1.8351.
