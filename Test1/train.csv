We have made strides with credibility with RAC regarding coal and we are doing a better job of seeing deals in general but I would like to put out a policy like this for us.,0,1

I will list some important things to me that I would like to discuss and propose some thoughts on positive changes for 2001. teamwork communication teaching guidance leadership - these are the major areas we should be thinking about how we can improve.,0,1
"try to identify team leaders to provide direction for that business, establish resources required to meet proposed budgets, and work on individual limits for the traders in those groups.",1,0
communication - once we have established global teams this should improve significantly.,0,1
'the road to hell is paved with good intentions' and until traders bonuses are directly tied to the profitability of someone in another office I don't think we will communicate as effectively we need to.,0,1
we have very few niche markets to exploit that provide us with guaranteed revenues or allow most of our physical traders the ability to trade well without a strong understanding of the push pull forces at work from the other centers.,0,1
for the last two years this has been cited a main area for improvement.,0,1
to get to where we want to be I feel it has to be done through global books.,0,1
teaching - given that the growth of the group has shifted away from hiring from the outside and toward internal recruiting we need to focus on how we develop and keep young talent.,0,1
"also, given the lack of depth in our trading group it is important that our best traders be given the additional responsibility for development of talent in their teams.",0,1
guidance - I feel that if we move toward smaller business units it will be easier for individuals to understand what the strategy is and what their specific role in that strategy is.,0,1
we lost a lot of people at this time last year and the common complaint amongst all of them was they couldn't see where this group was headed.,0,1
leadership - with a group of 114 people at last count it is important to start thinking about ways to encourage more people to make a greater personal investment in making this group a success.,0,1
not just meeting a budget but also in creating a business that will survive the exit of any individual.,0,1
a business that will have a competitive advantage and that those involved in it will be highly motivated to keep growing.,0,1
if there is consensus on the need to improve upon the above then we can analyse how we go about it.,0,1
I believe that by going toward global books we could improve upon many of our weaknesses.,0,1
chemistry is the major concern on a such move but best looked at in context of each group.,0,1
"there are many other important issues such as eol, marketing team, research group, recruitment, etc but I honestly think we have to focus first on how do we make most with the exisitng group and then figure out how to try to build upon it.",0,1
look forward to seeing you on weds aftn or thursday and please email when if you have free time to meet up.,0,1
"thanks, chris.",0,1
"Eric, I was examining EGM's businesses for 2001 and I wanted to ask you a question about your specific business.",0,1
"As you examine your goals and objectives, I would like to know what you think I could do to help you accomplish your plan.",0,1
Please send me a return email with 3 specific items that I could do personally to add to your business.,1,0

m,0,1
"Kathie, Thank you for your email.",0,1
I've been out and all over the world.,0,1
I appreciate your help on this article.,0,1
Attached is a copy of a presentation that will fill you in on some of the businesses that we are working on.,0,1
This should give you some ideas and clarifications on the first draft.,0,1
Here are a few other points of emphasis.,0,1
EGM was created to provide sharpened focus on very large global markets and commodities to enable them to grow quickly These markets are huge and we will become a big player rather than being active in them EGM provideds true network for market making opportunities related to commodities that are highly liquid in physical and financial terms and are enormous in market size EGM leverages the value of Enron's existing network and international asset positions EGM's operation will coordinate with leveraging all of our wholesale businesses EGM has very aggressive growth targets in transactions and earnings EGM has contributed almost 200 million in gross margin in its first 2 quarters in existence Go big or go home philosophy EGM will represent a clear transfer of Enron wholesale market making model into other commodities this year GROWTH is the key Thanks for your help.,0,1
Mark Frevert has requested that the Executive Letter be rotated among the presidents of EWS.,0,1
This is the inside cover message and should be 300 words.,0,1
I hope that you will be able to squeeze this into your busy schedule.,0,1
Here is a suggested outline.,0,1
"If you want to fill in the outline with information, I will be happy to turn it into a letter for you.",0,1
I. An overview of EWS EGM as we move forward.,0,1
II. A short-term retrospective about EGM activities and successes ,0,1
"III. Future plans initiatives for EGM strategic vision of the group, opportunities, expectations, etc.",0,1
Please feel free to modify as you see fit.,1,0
I have attached Greg Whalley's letter from our last issue to give you an idea of the format.,0,1
Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you.,1,0
"I need your letter by June 15, if possible.",1,0
Hope to hear from you soon.,0,1

"John, I previously asked you to quantify the global size of your business in Billions and you sent me a voice mail on it.",0,1
I have misplaced that note and don't remember the global size for the presentation.,0,1
Please re-provide as a return email.,1,0
Sorry for the inconvenience.,0,1
Mike,0,1
Dan Reck,0,1
"LK, Nice presentation, I'll give other comments later.",0,1
mike,0,1
"David, Thanks for the email.",0,1
It did cause an interesting conversation without knowing what the situation was.,0,1
We all have very open relationships around here it is why we are so successful as a company .,0,1
Please don't think twice about responding to Greg or any senior manager on an issue - but he would also have no issue with your response being cc back to Jeff and or myself at the same time.,1,0
"Thanks, Mike PS we are all thinking about P constantly.",0,1
"John and all, Please keep me informed on the progress.",1,0
Mark Frevert and I would like to meet him.,0,1
Greg has confirmed that the Astros have tentatively planned for President Chavez to throw out the first pitch on May 18.,0,1
We are exploring the possibility of a reception or other opportunity in cooperation with the Astros.,0,1
"As you suggested, we'll also look into other potential contacts.",0,1
I will be back in Houston on Thursday and Keith Miceli will be next Monday.,0,1
"Since it will likely take several weeks to flesh out the opportunities, I'd like to suggest that we limit e-mails to a work group of Habiba, Keith, Greg, you and me until we have more details to review with Mike and Eric.",1,0
"If you are going to be in Houston during the next two weeks, I'd recommend that we meet.",1,0
"In the interim, we will keep you apprised of further developments.",0,1
"In a meeting between Jeff Skilling and President Chavez in late-2000 I was in the meeting , Jeff invited Chavez to Enron Field as our guess.",0,1
"Obviously, Chavez was only visiting the city for a just hours and I believe the season started just a few days later.",0,1
"In any case, we have already done some previous lobby to get President Chavez to the Stadium.",0,1
This may help whoever is managing the contant with the Astros probably David T. .,0,1
I will probably not get much additional input from Caracas.,0,1
"Nevertheless, I strongly suggest that we position Enron as close as we can to this opportunity we will later see if President Chavez actually make it to Houston 2.",0,1
"In addition, in previous trips to Houston and in several ocassions, I believe Chavez has always met with George Bush senior and Mr.",0,1
Mosbacher.,0,1
I would not be surprised if he do it again.,0,1
Probably your team can also target these efforts and keep the action at all fronts Please keep me informed.,0,1
I would like to be involved as much as possible to move this ahead.,0,1
"While we are out of pocket, I'm asking Habiba Bayi, who directs PR support for EGM, to coordinate our involvement.",0,1
"Although international PR will manage meetings, functions, and general support strategy for this, I also am copying Dennis Vegas since sports marketing reports into him.",0,1
"As soon as they have information on the potential opportunities, we will get back to you with that information and a suggested program.",0,1
"If your contacts in Venezuela yield additional details, please let us know.",0,1
Otherwise we will pursue it from this end and keep you apprised and involved in the decision making process.,0,1
The Astros played some exhibition games in Venezuela last weekend.,0,1
This is obviously a wonderful opportunity for us to get closer to Chavez.,0,1
"Can we do something to be part of this activity with the Astros?, I copied John Ambler to see how we can coordinate the efforts from today.",1,0
We should not miss this opportunity if it really happen Emilio,0,1
What about David Turlip?,0,1
Also are there some other general announcements and or clarifications that you want to address?,0,1
"eg mid marketing, other new efforts or goals for the upcoming year.",0,1
"Mike Brown currently reporting to me and responsible for Asian as well as North and South American origination will continue to report to me and will focus on South American ,Carribean and Mexican origination.",0,1
"Doug Leach currently reporting to Mike Brown, and focusing on fuel supply will continue to focus his efforts on current fuel supply arrangements and work at developing new fuel supply contracts.",0,1
Doug will report to me in this role.,0,1
Victor Santos currently reporting to Mike Brown working on Asian origination will continue his focus on Asian origination and in this role will report to John Chismar.,0,1
"Suzanne, I glanced at the presentation.",0,1
It looks good.,0,1
Two comments: 1.,0,1
Could we use our older machines for home use?,0,1
They are still very good they just aren't the newest technology.,0,1
"All are fast, CD ready with plenty of memory.",0,1
It could knock the cost down significantly.,0,1
I would have the cost of Houston only to start with as a pilot.,0,1
That would reduce our initial costs significantly even for NA.,0,1
I recommend that you at least know what that cost is as a fall back position.,0,1
Good luck.,0,1
Your teams hard work really shows here.,0,1
mike,0,1
"Bob, Hello from S America.",0,1
I would recommend 2 people.,0,1
Both are obvious but Louise Kitchen should do EOL and Ken Rice is the best candidate for EBS.,0,1
If they aren't available they can pick an appropriate person.,0,1
"With such a broad cross-section of the state's senior leaders participating, including Skilling, Interactive Texas is going to be a major event.",0,1
We need to make certain Enron gets early access to exhibit or sponsorship opportunities.,0,1
Bob,0,1
"Joe, Howdy from Houston.",0,1
I would really like to discuss.,0,1
I've been out the last 2 Mondays and missed your calls.,0,1
I know your were out yesterday.,0,1
How about 5pm on thursday - Houston time.,0,1
Does that work?,0,1
"I am not implying that the relationship is not working, but as I will describe to you these opportunities are very large and I believe that we will need to ensure that a concerted effort is put forward.",0,1
I have briefly alluded to some of these with Jeff and with Gary as he was in Japan last week and they both seem interested.,0,1
Do you have a timeslot tomorrow where I can discuss these with you further?,0,1
Yes it was a very difficult decision to leave our group.,0,1
I've really enjoyed working with you and your group I think we have a great group.,0,1
I know you that you are working on this side of the business already and I will be giving you a call to get your input and direction.,0,1
Let me know how we can help you efforts in Europe We're already doing many thing in this area,1,0

It should make for a fun trip.,0,1

Have you heard anything on Hieple bad spelling arm?,0,1
If he is healthy I would take the points We have made reservations for Continental for spring break but need to make sure that the timing is fine before we confirm.,0,1
We plan to fly out on Tuesday and return on Saturday.,0,1
I have a scheduling problem to get there any earlier.,0,1

"See you in a couple of days Love to all, Mike Go ENE stock, we back to 85",0,1
"Mark, Thanks for the updates.",0,1
I have big news I'm changing jobs.,0,1
This is not announced yet but I am moving to the wholesale group with Frevert to become CEO for a new business unit called Enron Global Markets.,0,1
"It will contain the global commodities including Crude and products, coal, LNG, weather, insurance, FX interest rates equities, etc.",0,1
I think MEC is very cool and i am glad we are pursing it.,0,1
"Please keep Philippe, Jay and now Jeff McMahon in the loop.",0,1
Good luck with this and I look forward to hearing more about it's success.,0,1
Please keep this news to yourself until next week.,0,1
He is planning a meeting with Jim Tour to due diligence the technology.,0,1
"I would like to put together a team to drive MEC's strategy, including a consolidation in Houston.",0,1
We would trade this commitment for warrants in the company and a right to participate in future fundings.,0,1
"Effectively, our team could help drive the strategy for the company and due diligence a possible investment at the same time.",0,1
"Ideally, we could get that confirmation from someone familiar with the technology but without any financial interest in its success.",0,1
"Their technology pitch sounded good, but I don't know enough to recognize the potential shortcomings.",0,1
"I want to feel comfortable that you all feel this is real, then I would be happy to have me and my team spend some time with them.",0,1
We spoke with Harvey and Jim after the meeting and they took to speed to market comments to heart.,0,1
"There is an opportunity for Enron to participate with MEC in the early development of their company, but it seems the one thing they want is the one thing we also want, people.",0,1
I would appreciate your thoughts and comments on the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with MEC as part of a potential investment and strategic relationship.,1,0
"Given our resource constraints, this would most likely be part of the organization that sees the greatest strategic impact from MEC's development.",0,1
"Mark, Ouch, that stings.",0,1
Hopefully you are the only one that knows I know you can close the deal anyway Mike Mark Frevert ENRON 09 26 2000 08:59 AM To: Mike McConnell HOU ECT ECT cc: Subject: Re: EGM information I dont like your chances if you can't spell Gonzelas right Mark,0,1
"Billy, I like it.",0,1
My only suggestion is to put in a statement like - that after all your discussions with business unit head and AAs we are changing improving the program on the suggestions that you all wanted to see.,0,1
I think this could help everyone believe they were a part of the changes personally.,0,1
"Just an idea, I like it very much as it is.",0,1
"Good luck, m",0,1
Can you please arrange for this message to be sent to all of Enron - Houston this evening.,1,0

"Cathy Phillips It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's Juvenile Diabetes Foundation JDF walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.",0,1
I continue to serve on the board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts.,0,1
"As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.",0,1
"Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.",0,1
Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die.,0,1
Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.,0,1
JDF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84 of all money raised goes directly to research.,0,1
"Enron's goal this year is to raise 225,000 and we need your help.",0,1
"Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.",0,1
The theme for the walk this year is Knock Out Diabetes and we would like to have you join us for this great event.,0,1
The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.,0,1
"If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee members listed below.",1,0

"All, At our offsite in Miami next week, each of you are on the agenda to present your business and goals.",0,1
"This will be very short, only 20 minutes an agenda will soon follow but we will have a business meeting from 8am - 11:30am on Saturday .",0,1
Please prepare a few of pages on power point and submit to Cathy Phillips so that she can have all the presentations ready for that Saturday morning.,1,0
"Attached below is a copy of the abbreviated goals that I submitted to Frevert, summarizing EGM's 2001 goals.",0,1
"Please do not hesitate to change the list and add to it, it is only a guide and was used as a quick reference of EGM for the Enron board.",1,0
"After this meeting, I will take each of your presentations and make a more comprehensive goals and objectives list for EGM as a business unit.",0,1
Also please add some of your other specific goals that illustrate where you want to be by year end regarding your competitive position and or market share.,1,0
"For example, to be the largest marketer of coal in the US, to be the largest options player in crude and products, or what ever is appropriate.",0,1
"Also attached, for your information, is a recent presentation from the coal group.",0,1
We thought that this was an excellent format and review.,0,1
"In the upcoming weeks, we would like to see an update on each of your businesses as well.",0,1
I will let you know more in the next few weeks about the timing and format.,0,1
"Thanks, Mike",0,1
"Greg and Jeff, Attached is the draft announcement for the organization changes.",0,1
"I am sure you will want to change the ENW piece, so far the focus was on the wording from the wholesale side but the titles should be correct for ENW.",0,1

I will need to have a computer to play it and how to work it for the off-site on Monday.,0,1
"Thanks, mike",0,1
RAC came by and brought up a couple of concerns.,0,1
"1- the Var on this deal is over 120m more than all of ENE combined they wanted to make me aware of the size, and they know we are working on it.",0,1
and 2 - EE CC they were concerned about them doing the deal and their abilities and effects on MTM treatment.,0,1
I told them that they can bid on it but we want others to bid and that we probably won't use them.,0,1
They stated that the deal guys are acting like EE CC is a done deal.,0,1
Lets discuss.,0,1
"Thanks, mike",0,1
"Tom, Thanks for the email.",0,1
I talk around the group and see if your background fits our needs.,0,1
"mike Thomas Suffield ENRON 08 28 2000 09:12 AM To: Mike McConnell HOU ECT ECT cc: Subject: Opportunities Global Markets Mike: Randy Maffitt, recommended I send you my resume.",0,1

"I am currently in ENA, but with the scaling back of our development efforts and my Int'l experience, I thought we would have a lot to talk about.",0,1
"Thanks, Thomas x58286.",0,1
"Eric, is this still a problem or did you get what you needed?",0,1
What can J Wilson do thru 2010?,0,1
I want the crude desk to make us a price and present an acceptable volume.,0,1
"If we have to suggest to PDVSA only doing a crude index through 2012, I strongly believe we should try if we can create some additional value thru this structure.",0,1
Tell me if you would like me to give him a call to explain what the effort potentially create.,1,0
Thanks Eric Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp.,0,1
If we had 1 3 of our GSA price linked to Brent our exposure for 20 years would be about 30 million barrels notional or about 14 million barrels PV.,0,1
At 5 our exposure would still be 5 million notional or 2.3 million PV.,0,1
"According to John, he would not be comfortable doing anything past 2012 and even out that far he would not consider doing more than about 1 million PV barrels in the years 2010 - 2012.",0,1
"Given these comments, I would say that the size of our deal basically precludes a look at Crude Oil hedges at this time.",0,1
"As far as the economics of the deal are concerned, we basically cannot even get an Offer to use to figure out our economics.",0,1
"I am confident that if we pushed the issue to see if we could get a 20 year offer even for a small portion of the volumes that the hedging costs would be too high, and therefore have left it at that for the time being.",0,1
Please advise if you have any thoughts on the issue.,1,0
Please see below in blue our observations and answers.,0,1
Let's talk later today if you have further questions.,0,1
Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers.,0,1
In addition it preserves your 20 year offtake which should still match your GSA.,0,1
The agreement should start at commercial hand over of the plant as you say.,0,1
The draft as it is now has only outer limits as to when that should happen that being the earlier of 40 months after Financial Close or NTP or Dec 31 2004 .,0,1
We will add to this list the earlier of something like: the date on which the plant has produced LNG at at least 90 of its capacity for a period of 10 consecutive days .,0,1
"We suggest putting something like this as opposed to commercial hand over because this is in the plant's contractor's control and they could, for example, on purpose not meet a noise level requirement for 4 months for example and delay commencement of the offtake contract while the project sells LNG at higher prices than in the term sheets.",0,1
"With regards to the EPC LDs we agree that they should go only to the project but we, as offtakers, can not wait for ever for the project to be completed with out receiving gas or damages for something that is somehow directly or indirectly under the project's control.",0,1
We have 4 months limits to how much the project can be delayed on top of all the conservatism that EECC or another EPC Contractor already built in.,0,1
Section 6 I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing formula associated with expansions.,0,1
Structure could be set as in this contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of 18 .,0,1
"We agree that would be better, but we included this section knowing that is something that is going to be a very difficult sell with PDVSA, because they don't want us to sell down and then keep controlling new LNG businesses in Jose.",0,1
They will oppose this clause as they violently opposed the limited exclusivity at Jose that we managed to include in the GSA.,0,1
We think that adding a restriction to the asset's returns now in the draft will make it very tough to sell to PDVSA the entire Clause.,0,1
"Thus, jeopardizing our chance to control the output of future plants or expansions.",0,1
We never intended to use these off-take agreements as a vehicle to control future LNG volumes.,0,1
"Nevertheless, we felt it was a good chance for us to start getting partial control of the output.",0,1
Pushing it too much will back fire and PDVSA will clearly realize what our intent is.,0,1
Section 7 Where is the bonus calculation?,0,1
We did not include it now on purpose.,0,1
We will include it when ever they remind us to do so.,0,1
We want to have another fight about the bonus.,0,1
Where is the min price?,0,1
The minimum price is in.,0,1
We say that one of the terms in the price is Pg x En where En is never less than one I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number?,0,1
"We are going to try to do it, but that is first a GSA issue, and we don't want to put it here as something firm before we change it in the GSA.",0,1
We precisely bracketed the CPI percentage in the formula because of our thought that we want to make it zero Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics?,0,1
"No, we don't have the definitive answer from structuring yet, but our guess and based on our meeting with RAC the other day, in which they told us about the mess created by an oil escalation in Cuiba Brazil power plant , we are pretty much convinced that oil escalation without oil based LNG sales is not convenient.",0,1
"But since we don't have a definitive answer yet we still included oil as a possible escalator with a zero weighting that should have been bracketed in the term-sheet, though, and it will .",0,1
Section 10 you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the Equilibrium rate.,0,1
Is this your intent to have a mismatch?,0,1
"Yes, we did it on purpose because this will apply also to PDVSA as off-taker, and they have a record of paying late so we want them to suffer if they do.",0,1
you have all new taxes being borne by the project company.,0,1
Will the banks accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalized.,0,1
See section 18 of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue.,0,1
"The exporter of record will be the project, so the buyer has no business in Venezuela other than paying port fees.",0,1
We do not see any kind of taxes that could be imposed on Buyer by Venezuela that would eventually be transferred to the project.,0,1
Banks should be fine with this as this is a risk that projects typically take all the time the heavy crude projects are some examples in Venezuela .,0,1
"In addition, the GSA provides for a number of reliefs for the Project Company that will help Banks and equity holders to feel safer.",0,1
"Although, a large portion of the underlying risk is always there.",0,1
Other where are the LD calculations explained?,0,1
I think you need LDs for GSA default and another for plant default.,0,1
GSA default should match LD's in GSA contract less compensation to plant debt recovery.,0,1
In stead of writing an explicit LD calculation our lawyers suggested that the sole use of New York law to rule the deal was simpler and better.,0,1
New York law provides for full market based damages market price of commodity plus extra costs which is the maximum you can get in a negotiation for an LD clause.,0,1
"So, from a legal and commercial point of view we much rather have it as it is.",0,1
"We are still discussing w Brent Price and Cris Sherman if this is sellable to AA for MTM, but our initial view is that it should be since the level of LD can not be better.",0,1
"GSA default is market based provided that PDVSA, as we expect, accepts the change we will propose so the Project Company will be able to pay market based damages.",0,1
"For interruption of gas supply from PDV for Force Majeure reasons our insurance team is finding out if the market will cover such risk so that the project can afford not being relieved from performance in such event this will obviously be to a maximum dollar limit to be determined and for a maximum period of time, say 36 months - we need time to give you precision on this, but some sort of coverage will be available .",0,1
suppose the plant produces 5 less that it is supposed to due to design or tech problems not a FM issue at commercial hand over.,0,1
What happens under the offtake agreements?,0,1
Will the banks accept this revenue short fall?,0,1
Will we have to create a reserve?,0,1
This may be a big issue with the banks for technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry.,0,1
Under the off-take agreements the project pays market based damages if it does not meet the contracted volume.,0,1
We believe that the contracted volume that we included in the term sheets though has enough of a cushion for banks and equity holders to bear the risk.,0,1
We are contracting for contractually guaranteed production under the EPC which is 3 lower than expected.,0,1
On top of that we are considering LNG production with the richest inlet gas possible meaning a lower LNG volume .,0,1
This volume is 5 lower than the guaranteed production with Normal or expected feed composition.,0,1
Combining these two we have a contracted quantity that is 8 lower than the expected production with expected feed.,0,1
On top of this it is important to note that every single LNG plant in the world ended up with a production capacity that is at least 10 above what was expected mostly due to EPC Contractors and tech partners making very safe assumptions on guaranteed volumes to avoid LDs .,0,1
Also the EPC contract being negotiated provides for pretty severe LD in case of production shortfalls that are enough to pay for debt and make equity-holders whole.,0,1
"They don't provide though, for damages payable under off-take contracts nobody will take this potentially huge exposure on LDs .",0,1
"However, as we explained, we believe that this is a risk that is typically taken by producers and that we have already taken a very conservative assumption in the volume contracted and that should be beard by the Project Co.",0,1
"Banks will most definitely also take a conservative volume assumption, as we already did.",0,1
What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is resolved?,0,1
what compensation do the offtakers get?,0,1
do the banks suffer here as well?,0,1
The term sheet establishes an annual quantity as the only standard to determine failure to deliver by Seller.,0,1
It also establishes that deliveries should be at rates and intervals that are reasonably constant.,0,1
The bottom line is that the termsheets do not go into all the detail about timing of defaults and price differentials.,0,1
"It sets, however, a reasonable standard by which if at the end of the year seller did not deliver the full annual quantity and a particular month can be identified where the deficiency occur based on the reasonable constant deliveries provision, damages will be payable based on prices during such month.",0,1
Yes banks suffer here to the extent that the cause of the short fall is not insurable.,0,1
"Nevertheless, short periods weeks of failures to deliver by seller will really not affect the Project Company ability to pay the Banks.",0,1
It will have to be some prolonged period for Banks to be affected.,0,1
Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first 60 days.,0,1
Will the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established.,0,1
Is this in your model?,0,1
"We are not sure off what the banks are going to require in this regard although, we agree that some sort of reserve or LC is to be expected .",0,1
Our model assumes the cost of an LC for 6 month debt service which should be plenty .,0,1
The issue here is if MTM is going to be able to live with the same or longer grace period for damages to kick in under the termsheet and weather damages not BI are insurable and to what extent if FM relief is not permitted for MTM reasons.,0,1
"The question that follows is: if damages exceed the insured limits in a FM event that does not relief the project from its obligation to deliver, have the damages have to be senior to debt payments for AA to allow MTM to be permitted?",0,1
"If this is so, are the banks going to be willing to live with this?, probably not.",0,1
insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling.,1,0
It is briefly covered in section 9 second paragraph.,0,1
This will be expended in later drafts once the PA is signed and we are home free with regard to PDVSA.,0,1
insert termination section In light of the fact that we will end up being more of an off-taker than an asset owner in this project our lawyers suggest that we will get better protection if early termination is ruled by what is provided under NY law than if we try to right an early termination clause.,1,0
"They point out also that 90 of LNG contracts are done in this way, having NY law rule the game.",0,1
They point out also that from the project point of view banks are very used to and prefer having early termination be ruled by NY law.,0,1
put something in about the buyer willing to accept entering direct agreements for financing requirements?,1,0
Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers.,0,1
In addition it preserves your 20 year offtake which should still match your GSA.,0,1
I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number?,0,1
Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics?,0,1
Section 10 you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the Equilibrium rate.,0,1
Is this your intent to have a mismatch?,0,1
you have all new taxes being borne by the project company.,0,1
Will the banks accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalised.,0,1
See section 18 of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue.,0,1
Other where are the LD calculations explained?,0,1
"Jeannie, Hello, I'm back this morning from overseas.",0,1

"Rick, While in Tokyo, Sanjay grabbed Jeff and me regarding redoing and re-looking at the existing LNG fuel deals for Dabhol.",0,1
"The bottom line is that he believes that the government may have issues on actually performing post phase 2 and if we could redo the LNG contracts and allow more flexibility we could help them, thus help ourselves.",0,1
We need to look into this and I would like your initial opinion.,0,1
This is complex to say the least and it would involve using the ship differently than scheduled and diverting some of the Oman LNG to other markets with their approval.,0,1
He believes that there is some flexibility in the shipping and Oman contracts to address these issues.,0,1
If it works we could create a long physical condition and an extra ship for transport.,0,1
Is there an opportunity here if all the cards fall into place?,0,1
Lets discuss when I am in Dubai.,0,1
Sanjay is not going to let it go so you need to think about who can look into this further.,0,1

I didn't know exactly how it was structured.,0,1
I am waiting on the revised draft from Frevert.,0,1
After I get that one I will circulate it to Greg for his additions for the Net Works pieces.,0,1
I don't believe that we are going to add Shankman to the executive committee right now.,0,1
I am assuming the same is for Lavo.,0,1
There may be an appropriate time in the near future to make changes to the committee and they may be considered then.,0,1
I don't think they want to add any additional people at this time.,0,1
"Mark may have a different opinion and if he does, I am sure he will add it.",0,1

Enron Japan Joe is building an impressive team and he has a thorough and well thought o ut 20 business plan.,0,1
Japan has the opportunity to be really big another Enron 20 Europe?,0,1
and we have an excellent opportunity to get it right from the star t 20 and drive this market.,0,1
He is in a unique position to develop a huge busine ss 20 and drive it with technology without having the burden of a large legacy 20 problem.,0,1
I think they look more like an Enron Net Works type of business 20 than most the other business units.,0,1
Enron Japan needs to use the internet to 20 educate and drive this new business to achieve the penetration it needs 20 without an incumbent position.,0,1
The competition and market characteristics 20 fit very well with our statements about ENW in our general presentations.,0,1
Our technology efforts are paying dividends Inja Chug 01 Sr.,0,1
Director was 20 dedicated here a few months ago .,0,1
Her impact is significant and will great ly 20 assist in IPO 20 ?,0,1
eCommerce ENW will be an enormous impact in increasing the value of 20 SK-Enron when they IPO next year.,0,1
The internet and eCommerce technology 20 changes should be able to significantly increase their multiple and provide 20 Enron with a profitable exit option.,0,1
I want you to pick the number you want me to reference as our potential market share target and a potential margin number extrapolated from that.,1,0
Please respond ASAP with what you feel comfortable with.,1,0
"Thanks, mike",0,1
"Vance, I've been attempting to call you .",0,1
Your voicemail is full and my return voicemail keeps getting rejected.,0,1
I suggest you clear out some room.,1,0
I would be happy to change my schedule and meet either at 12 or 12:30.,0,1
I don't really want an hour with him but will do what you need.,0,1
mike,0,1
Thanks.,0,1
I am confident we can get it done even though it will be a fire drill.,0,1
"We had a control or process matrix meeting today and it is all there, it was just being held or managed in four places.",0,1
"It will all be pulled together by Monday in one place one complete document and will have about 15 major categories with specific tasks under each category with status, person responsible, comments and date to be completed.",0,1
It will also have a complete timeline.,0,1
We can review that Monday and agree on its content.,0,1
Louise agreed to review it as well.,0,1
"As it relates to the people you mentioned, let me know how and or who you want to pull in after we agree on the control document.",0,1
That way we will know which areas I have holes and how we can fill them.,0,1
Salley Beck called she mentioned you had called her as well and we agreed that the ClickPaper's back office representative would officially be Scott Earnest he has been unofficially it for months and we have been working with him for months .,0,1
She is going to get in place people to be our Product Control Group for CP launch on July 24th.,0,1
"Scott and Salley will work to source it so that we have 3 or 4 people trained and ready on the 24th to receive password applications, create customer profiles on ClickPaper and start the applications through credit, legal and tax and finally get out user IDs to clients.",0,1
We will leverage off the EOL process but not use their people unless there is some emergency.,0,1
"Remember, we are only setting up people for paper so the process is somewhat simplified.",0,1
We also have a help desk person starting next week.,0,1
"I don't have his name yet, but we have him and one more on the way.",0,1
We will create for them a brief manual and train them on the system as fast as we can.,0,1
I did have a good meeting with Louise and Dave.,0,1
We walked inch by inch through getting a user ID and password to getting a trade done.,0,1
"We have a few holes, but it is not that far away.",0,1
She is going to think about a process document for this and get back to me Monday.,0,1
I have a detailed EOL one and we will give it our shot this weekend.,0,1
Let me know what Mark Palmer says.,1,0
He knows we have been using Margaret.,0,1
We will sit down with Margaret again on Monday and detail for her the PR plan and what she needs to do.,0,1
We still plan to go out with a fairly inclusive mailing a letter that does not include temporary IDs passwords.,0,1
"We will tell them that the launch is coming and as special customers, we want to use this time to get them pre-registered.",0,1
"Besides, there is no way to test a 1000 temporary IDs anyway.",0,1
We will send those out later.,0,1
"as I said earlier, the goal is to replace the splash screen with the unsecure area or garden as Lousie would call it by next for Friday or the following Monday.",0,1
That way people can surf the content and get registered.,0,1
"On legal, I have been using Travis McCullough for at least four months and we had a detailed discussion today about the contracts, what is needed and the deadline.",0,1
"There is legal work left to do the current draft of the password application doesn't work , but if Taylor can help, that would be great.",0,1
We will get our commercial comments back to Travis by Monday.,0,1
I have a meeting Monday with Bill Bradford and Ted Murphy with Bob Crane and Hal as well to discuss the issue of a manual interface and the control issues associated with it.,0,1
"Credit is fine, we have been working with Bradford for months, but Murphy needs to understand the issues with manual posting.",0,1
I will also make sure they check with Rick Buy on his approval and views.,0,1
The entire ENA Paper group has the link to our site and we will have all their comments by the end of next week.,0,1
They will also be given the complete Net Works and ClickPaper story on Thursday at their offsite and are ready to help the roll out.,0,1
"We also have them scheduled to come in Saturday, July 22nd for the final testing of the system.",0,1
"Remember, the 24th is a one Enron -to-many launch with a financial market only.",0,1
"ClickPaper is not the counterparty in the trade section, Enron is so it is simply a new distribution channel for Enron's existing financial offering.",0,1
"Later, we will build it out for physical probably sooner rather than later .",0,1
"Finally, I will incorporate the EOL link or transaction loop but Louise said today that is October or November.",0,1
It will only be many-to-many if someone comes in and makes a compelling case to do so.,0,1
Thanks.,0,1
See you tomorrow.,0,1
"Randy, Thanks for the email.",0,1
"Yes, life is wild at Enronville.",0,1

"We'll ask for suggestions on local law engineering firms, plus see what Sam can do to help us.",0,1
Any instructions?,0,1
"If not, I'll proceed as planned.",0,1

Also send next draft and final to Jeff McMahon and Greg Whalley.,1,0

I thought it was very thorough and hits all the main points that we are thinking about right now.,0,1
Jeff and I are very bullish on the opportunities in Japan are just now focusing on the specifics.,0,1
I believe that will also drive the structure.,0,1
You should have received an EGM overview yesterday and it will be an excellent brief on what we are doing and our general direction.,0,1
I am very interested in having both you and Joe look at that and provide feedback on the opportunities in Japan.,0,1
"We can talk about all of your issues later, when we are more prepared, but on the PRC issue, the key is not simply P L but on transactions and growing the business.",0,1
I believe that these businesses with proper focus and dedication can grow quickly and show success even though the margins may be small.,0,1
I am glad that you are coming over and also touring Enron Europe and ENA.,0,1
It will help you make a better decision and we will have all of this clarified in the mean time.,0,1
Jeff and I will be talking about some of these points tomorrow as well.,0,1
"Thanks, Mike",0,1
Thanks for the update.,0,1
"Cool, I don't know what it tells me but I love it.",0,1
It looks like a map of world domination Mike,0,1
"All, Attached is the first draft of an EGM update and org memo.",0,1
"Please take a few minutes and review, add what is necessary for your section and return ASAP.",1,0
Other comments are welcome as well.,0,1

Please do so on a hard copy and have brought up.,1,0
I will incorporate your changes.,0,1
Some of the changes in the memo are still under consideration and need to be considered extremely confidential.,0,1
This needs a lot of work and filler.,0,1
Also add a one line update or positive statement about your business as an intro line of the section.,1,0

"When it came to the review process itself, Global Technology ranked all the employees and peers but the business unit had the greatest influence on where the person actually ranked and was rated.",0,1
"If it's OK with you, I'd like to put it in the present tense as I understand this is still the case today.",0,1

Thanks much.,0,1
"Regards, Gary Anthes",0,1
"Joe, Thanks for the email.",0,1
Project Summer does bring up some big questions and issues and I am not up to speed on the current thinking.,0,1
We'll talk later and i'll find out the issues and viewpoints.,0,1
"On your other issue, I understand and we'll discuss.",0,1
Given that we have been pursuing this stuff through a matrix approach many questions arise.,0,1
I am not sure of the Project Summer view or the Enron view.,0,1
I have the feeling it is not a big blip on anyone's radar screen.,0,1
I did not bring this up during the weekly call because D'Arcy and Steve do not know anything at least officially and or from me .,0,1
"Also, for what it is worth, I am assessing personal options at this point.",0,1
I am not necessarily wed to the Newco unless Enron puts out a former EI hiring moratorium despite what people may be assuming.,0,1

"Pelt, We have made reservations for Fri.",0,1
"and Sat, I didn't make yours but i would move quickly.",0,1
Would you like me to set up a tee time and massages for the girls?,0,1
I figured a 1 pm tee time?,0,1
Also what about tickets for the game itself.,0,1
Will you have access as years gone by or does the search need to begin?,0,1
Possibly a little golf and R R mixed in with the game.,0,1
It would be a bit out of the way.,0,1
We might go up as early as Friday morning to play golf that afternoon.,0,1
Let me know what you think.,1,0
I was very moved by it and you know I feel the same way.,0,1
I have become very reflective with the more success that I have been fortunate enough to receive.,0,1

I see so many people that have lost their perspective and I pray that I will remain grounded and truly appreciate the blessings that our family has received.,0,1
Chris and I often discuss how we can help others and what can we do to really make a difference.,0,1
The Jones and the McConnells are truly very lucky.,0,1

Can you please send your contact information phone number and location to me and Mike so that we can get you signed up on a team.,1,0

He could also report to us obviously like Larry but i think in this case a dual role makes a lot of sense.,0,1
What do you think?,0,1
"If you like Don, he could be an immediate candidate to start doing our Corp Dev work, but that is of course not the best reason.",0,1
I thought he was all right and he did have a good understanding of our products and is an innovative thinker.,0,1
"He has also worked as a trader and although it doesn't seem possible by his personality, having some background is a plus.",0,1
Mike,0,1
Hi Mary Anne - I am responding to your message on behalf of Mike McConnell.,0,1
Mike is in Singapore at this time and we are not sure if he will be successful in dialing up to catch up on his e-mail correspondence.,0,1
Thank you very much for your message.,0,1
We solicit one time lump-sum contributions to JDF rather than per mile.,0,1
"In addition, we collect the pledges for the walk - rain or shine.",0,1
The reason of course is that our main goal is to raise money to find a cure and we would prefer that weather or other elements beyond our control not impact our ability to raise funds.,0,1
"However, we have a great time on walk day and we have a lot of people turn out for the walk.",0,1
This year we are anticipating in excess of 500 walkers.,0,1
The total amount of donations that are turned in by Enron employees are very generously matched dollar-for-dollar by the Enron Foundation.,0,1
"Therefore, the matching forms are not necessary.",0,1
If you happen to be in Houston on November 5th we would enjoy having you join us for the walk.,0,1
"If you care to make a donation, it may be mailed to Mike at the following address: Mike McConnell Enron Global Markets 1400 Smith Street, EB 3328 Houston, TX 77002 If you donate 25 or more you are entitled to an Enron JDF Walk T-shirt.",0,1
If you are interested just send us your size M-L-XL-XXL and location and we will get one to you.,1,0
Thanks again.,0,1
"Although I don't have the funds to fly down to Houston to participate, I'd be happy to at least make a donation How are the donations tallied?",0,1
Pledge per mile walked?,0,1

Let me know I too am an insulin dependant diabetic - for 32 years now - and do know what a child goes through when diagnosed with this disease.,0,1
I just thank God that I have parents that instilled a strong sense of self and urged me to understand as much about the disease as possible.,0,1
"I've seen too many kids and young adults, in my association with the Oregon Chapter of the JDF, that didn't understand and didn't want to deal with their diabetes - some of them dying at a very young age due to complications.",0,1
"I volunteer my time to talk to newly diagnosed diabetic children, so they and their parents can understand that it isn't a death sentence, it's a way of life.",0,1
And a way of life that can be long and productive.,0,1

"George's group has already put a presentation together about i2, the products and possible applications.",0,1
"George, please sent that to John.",1,0
I would like that document to be our updated business plan for i2 to be used as a living document as we move forward.,0,1
Assign someone to make and co-ordinate the use and full deployment of those products utilize our 10 million spend .,1,0
I want someone to have the responsibility for i2 and he or she can also work with EBS on what they are doing also.,0,1
"To be clear, we have spent the 10 million already but are not using the products.",0,1
I want to deploy all if possible and make this investment fully utilized.,0,1
I do understand that we don't drive businesses around a pre-purchased product but we should look at is as a sunk cost and rationalize why we shouldn't use if rather that simply considering it as an option.,0,1
I didn't see the draft reorg memo we've been talking about for a while.,0,1
